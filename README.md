## Environment set up
I'm gonna use a VM in AWS following the next steps:

1. Create an account in AWS.
2. Create en EC2 instance, that is, a virtual machine. I will create it with Ubuntu as OS.
3. When I create the VM, as I follow the instructions, I'm gonna use a "key pair" to securely connect to my VM. As I don't have yet any key pair I'm gonna create a new one.
4. While creating the key pair select:
   * Key pair type: RSA
   * Private key file format: .pem
5. After clicking on "Create key pair" button the .pem file will be downloaded.
